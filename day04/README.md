## How to use
 - inspect the page and open the console

## Learning notes
 
 - use `console.table()` instead of `console.log()` to display result as a table
 - `filter()` method returns a new array with all elements that pass the test defined by the given function
 - `map()` method creates a new array with the results of calling the given function for every element in an array and constructs new array from results
 - `sort()` method sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the array
 - combined `filter()` and `map()` methods 
 - `reduce()` method applies a function simultaneously against two values of the array (from left-to-right) as to reduce it to a single value
